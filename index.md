<summary><strong>About</strong></summary>

A couple-sentence bio goes here. Replace this with a short description of who you are, what you build, and what you care about.

**Example:**  
I build low-level systems, networking tools, and developer libraries. Mostly D and C# — love clean interfaces and small, well-tested tools.
